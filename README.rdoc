FreeCodeCamp's original assignment is to create a "Nightlife Coordination App." This is my version: an app that can search Yelp for nearby dog parks and coordinate between authenticated users to see where your dog owner friends are planning to take their dogs.

A rails backend with React.js. Authentication by Devise.
